# Product Guidelines: Descomplica DEV Na Gringa

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional & Direct:** The communication must be no-nonsense, analytical, and objective. It should focus on providing value through clarity and evidence rather than emotional hype.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & Dark:** The page uses a dark aesthetic (utilizing Slate/Zinc shades) with vibrant, high-contrast accent colors like Cyan and Indigo.
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., 'Outfit') to ensure readability and a high-tech feel.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** The value proposition and core message must be immediately obvious to the visitor without unnecessary jargon or complex navigation.
- **Strategic Social Proof:** Testimonials and audit evidence should be positioned to support claims and build trust throughout the user journey.
- **Technical Polish:** Since the target audience consists of developers, the site must be performant, responsive, and follow clean HTML/CSS practices.
